# Development Philosophy

* Library project - intended to be integrated into other software.
* Minimal dependencies - project implemented in pure C++11 with as few dependencies as possible.
* Common Dependencies - all used are open source, well known, widely used (curl, libyaml, etc.)
* Code Coverage - better than 90% code coverage as a goal.
